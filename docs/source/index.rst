Welcome to the Sims pipelines documentation!
============================================

The Sims pipelines use `ruffus <http://www.ruffus.org.uk/>`_
and `cgat-core <https://cgat-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to write and execute bioinformatics workflows locally or on
high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
