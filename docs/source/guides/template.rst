Working with the template pipeline
==================================

This page describes how to work with the template pipeline,
`pipeline_template <https://github.com/sims-lab/pipeline_template/>`_.

That repository provides a boilerplate for rapidly setting up GitHub repositories
for new production pipelines.

Getting started
---------------

Preparing your project on GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start, `sign in to GitHub <https://github.com/login>`_
and navigate to `the template pipeline <https://github.com/sims-lab/pipeline_template/>`_,
where you will see a green :guilabel:`Use this template` button.
Click it to open a new page that will ask you for some details:

* Leave the default "Owner", or change it to something better for a tutorial project.
* Introduce an appropriate "Repository name", for example ``pipeline_tutorial``.
* Make sure the project is "Public", rather than "Private".

.. note::

   The template repository includes a GitHub Action workflow for continuous integration.
   Public repositories do not have any usage limit on GitHub Action, but private repositories do.

After that, click on the green :guilabel:`Create repository from template` button,
which will generate a new repository on your personal account
(or the one of your choosing).
This is the repository you will use to develop and version control your new pipeline,
and it contains the following files and sub-directories:

.. _template structure:

``.github/workflows/build.yml``
  Sub-directory that contains instructions for GitHub Action workflows.
  You will need to edit this file with instructions specific to each pipeline
  that is derived from the template (e.g., download test files,
  name of the Conda environment).

``envs/``
  Sub-directory that contains YAML files describing Conda environments
  for running or testing the pipeline.
  You will edit those files as you develop the pipeline,
  to provide all the dependencies that are needed for
  the GitHub Action workflow and end-users.

``etc/``
  Sub-directory that contains additional files needed specifically 
  for continuous integration, you will leave it untouched.

``README.md``
  Basic description of the repository.
  You will edit it as you see fit.

``config.yml``
  YAML file that is used to configure parameters of the pipeline.
  You will edit this file as you develop the pipeline,
  to provide a template and default values that can be edited by users
  for each run of the pipeline.

``pipeline.py``
  Python script that describes the pipeline steps and overall workflow.
  You will edit this file as you develop the pipeline,
  adding new tasks, importing new modules, and managing the overall 
  workflow feeding the output of some task as the input to others.

First steps
-----------

Checking the first build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GitHub will automatically try to run the GitHub Action workflows
of your project right after you create it.
To see the build logs, click on the orange circle icon next to
the commit ID on the project repository,
or alternatively navigate to the "Action" page,
then open the one on top (the most recent one).

If the build has not finished yet by the time you open it,
you will see a yellow indicator, meaning that it is still
in progress. However, even the logs of builds in progress
can be viewed as they are being produced.

When the build finishes, you will see a green indicator (red in case of failure),
the status of the build, the elapsed time, and download links to artifacts
that contain the output files generated by the pipeline.
If you now click on any of the build jobs, you will see the full logs
of commands run during the GitHub Action workflow, and their outputs.

.. note::

   The logs of GitHub Action workflows are extremely valuable in the case of failure,
   for debugging and fixing the pipeline (or the GitHub Action workflow itself).
   Some of the steps in the workflow report information about the Conda installation,
   and the environment in which the workflow is executed.
   We also encourage pipeline developers to implement unit tests that validate the 
   outputs of the pipeline.

Basic configuration changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now proceed to make some basic configuration adjustments.
Navigate back to the project repository and click on the :guilabel:`Settings`
button, which will open the Settings page.

First of all, click on the :guilabel:`Branches` menu,
and then the :guilabel:`Add rule` button.

* Set "Branch name" to ``main``.
* Tick the checkbox "Require a pull request before merging".
* Untick the checkbox "Require approvals".
* Tick the checkbox "Require status checks to pass before merging".
* In the search bar below, type "build" and select all of the options that appear (e.g. ``build (3.8)``, ``build (3.9)``).
* Tick the checkbox "Require linear history".
* Tick the checkbox "Include administrators".
* Click the :guilabel:`Create` button.
* Type your GitHub account password, if prompted.

.. note::

   The template repository includes a branch ``main`` that is used to initialise
   your copy of the template. Branch protection rules ensure that contributors
   to the repository respect certain best practices when publishing new updates
   to the repository.
   
   In this instance, we make sure that no one (including
   administrators) can commit directly to the branch ``main``. Instead, every
   contribution must be made through a branch and a pull request.
   We also block pull requests from being merged until the selected status checks pass.
   Finally, we require a linear history on the branch ``main``, meaning that
   pull requests must be merge using either the "rebase" or the "squash" strategy,
   resulting in a much more readable Git history on the branch ``main``.

Trigger a build from a pull request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GitHub Action workflow automatically triggers builds from GitHub pull requests,
allowing you to verify that status checks pass before you merge the changes to the
main branch of the repository.

To demonstrate this, navigate to your GitHub repository, locate the file ``README.md``,
and click the pencil icon on the top-right with the tooltip "Edit this file"
to open a web editor.

In the editor, in the first line, replace the two occurences of ``sims-lab/pipeline_template``
by the name of your own repository (e.g. ``kevinrue/pipeline_tutorial``).

.. note::

   We are editing the code that represents the status check of a GitHub Action workflow,
   to display the status of your own repository.
   The full line representing the badge can be obtained as follows:

   * Navigate to your GitHub repository
   * Click on the :guilabel:`Actions` tab at the top of the page.
   * Click on the :guilabel:`CI` workflow in the left pane.
   * Click on the :guilabel:`...` button in the top right corner of the main pane.
   * Click on the "Create status badge" option.
   * Click on the :guilabel:`Copy status badge Markdown` button.
   * You can then paste this as-is, typically at the top of your ``README.md`` file.

Write an appropriate commit message,
and notice that the "Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request" option
is already selected (due to the branch protection rule that we set earlier).
Type a name for the new branch, or use the proposed name.
When you are done, click the green :guilabel:`Propose changes` button,
which will take you to the new pull request page,
and there click the :guilabel:`Create pull request` button below the description.

After opening the pull request, one or more GitHub Action checks will appear
(depending on the number of status checks that you selected in the page of
branch protection rules).
A yellow icon indicates that the workflow is running,
while green or red icons indicate successful completion or failure, respectively.
If you click on the :guilabel:`Details` link -- while it is running or after completion --
you will access the build logs.
When the status checks pass and you are satisfied, you can merge the pull request!

Where to go from here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, you have a working copy of a minimal pipeline that uses its own files
as input data to compute a word count and load the results in an SQLite database.

You will want to edit the files in the `template structure`_ to replace their contents with
your own pipeline steps, set the default configuration of your pipeline,
and declare the dependencies that must be present in the Conda environments used to
run and test the pipeline.

about the Sims-lab pipelines:

* Code styling
* Documentation
* ... and more!
