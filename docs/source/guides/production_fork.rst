Developing production pipelines
====================================

This guide describes how to obtain a copy of a production pipeline
with the intention to edit it and contribute the changes back to the
parent repository.
To develop a whole new pipeline from scratch, refer to :doc:`/guides/template`.

Production pipelines are subject to change over time,
following updates to dependencies and best practices in the field.
Contributions to production pipelines can be made directly on the repository,
or through pull requests from forks of the repository.

Getting started
---------------

Preparing your project on GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start, `sign in to GitHub <https://github.com/login>`_
and navigate to the repository of the production pipeline, e.g.
`pipeline_rnaseq_hisat2 <https://github.com/sims-lab/pipeline_rnaseq_hisat2/>`_,
where you will see a grey button :guilabel:`Fork` in the top-right corner of the page.

* Click it to open a modal window that will ask you where you want to fork that repository.
* Select your GitHub username, or something suitable for a tutorial project.

This will generate a new repository on your personal account
(or the one of your choosing).
This is the repository you will use to work on the pipeline and prepare pull requests
to the parent repository, and it contains the following files and sub-directories:

``.github/workflows/build.yml``
  Sub-directory that contains instructions for GitHub Action workflows.
  In most cases, you will leave it untouched; however, you may need to
  occasionally update it with fixes, or to add new custom steps
  (e.g., download additional test input files to test new steps in the pipeline).

``data/``
  Sub-directory where users will download the input FASTQ files for this guide.
  In most cases, you will leave this untouched, as the pipeline is automatically
  tested by GitHub Action workflows triggered by every new commit pushed to
  a pull request on the GitHub repository.
  You might occasionally decide to set up test input files in this sub-directory,
  to test the pipeline on your local computer, in which case you will be careful
  not to commit those data files to Git!

``envs/``
  Sub-directory that contains YAML files describing Conda environments
  for running or testing the pipeline. You may update those files when identifying
  new dependencies required by your updates to the pipeline, or removing deprecated
  dependencies required by software that is not used anymore following updates to
  the pipeline.

``etc/``
  Sub-directory that contains additional files needed specifically 
  for continuous integration.
  You will update the file ``etc/ci_checks.sh`` to add or remove the path to
  expected output files following updates to the pipeline. This file is used
  to verify that all the expected files are present at the end of the pipeline run
  during the GitHub Action.

``README.md``
  Basic description of the repository.
  You will edit it as you see fit.

``config.yml``
  YAML file that is used to configure parameters of the pipeline.
  The file is included with example values.
  You will update this file with values that match your updates to the pipeline.
  Updates range from editing existing values, to adding or removing fields
  that control new or deprecated parameters of the pipeline controlled by users.

``pipeline.py``
  Python script that describes the pipeline steps and overall workflow.
  You will edit this file with updates to the existing pipeline tasks, and
  possibly extend the pipeline with new tasks or remove deprecated functionality.

Triggering the first build

GitHub will automatically detect GitHub Action workflows
in your project, but on forked repositories it requires you to explicitly
allow them to run, for security reasons.

Click on the green button :guilabel:`I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`.
This will take you to the "Actions" page of the repository,
where you will find the list of workflows (one workflow) and workflow runs (empty so far).

* Click on the workflow :guilabel:`CI`, in the left pane.
* On the right, click on the grey button :guilabel:`Run workflow`,
  leave ``main`` as the selected branch,
  and click on the green button :guilabel:`Run workflow`.

After a few seconds, an entry will appear in the main panel,
representing the first run of the workflow.

To see the build logs, click on the title of the workflow run.

When the build finishes, you will see a green indicator (red in case of failure),
the status of the build, the elapsed time, and download links to artifacts
that contain the output files generated by the pipeline.
If you now click on any of the build jobs, you will see the full logs
of commands run during the GitHub Action workflow, and their outputs.

   Logs of a GitHub Action workflow run

.. note::

   The logs of GitHub Action workflows are extremely valuable in the case of failure,
   for debugging and fixing the pipeline (or the GitHub Action workflow itself).
   Some of the steps in the workflow report information about the Conda installation,
   and the environment in which the workflow is executed.

   When continuing development on the fork of a production pipeline,
   it is entirely normal to occasionally run into build failures,
   as you test new code or bug fixes.
   However, it is crucial that you do every effort to restore a successful build,
   as this is an absolute requirement to merge a pull request to the parent repository.
   In doubt, contact the maintainer of the parent repository for help and advice
   (e.g., open a Github issue on the parent repository).
