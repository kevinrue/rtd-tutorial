Developing production pipelines
====================================

This guide describes how to obtain a copy of a production pipeline
with the intention to edit it and contribute the changes back to the
parent repository.
To develop a whole new pipeline from scratch, refer to :doc:`/guides/template`.

Production pipelines are subject to change over time,
following updates to dependencies and best practices in the field.
Contributions to production pipelines can be made directly on the repository,
or through pull requests from forks of the repository.
