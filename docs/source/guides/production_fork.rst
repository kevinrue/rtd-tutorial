Developing production pipelines
====================================

This guide describes how to obtain a copy of a production pipeline
with the intention to edit it and contribute the changes back to the
parent repository.
To develop a whole new pipeline from scratch, refer to :doc:`/guides/template`.

Production pipelines are subject to change over time,
following updates to dependencies and best practices in the field.
Contributions to production pipelines can be made directly on the repository,
or through pull requests from forks of the repository.

Getting started
---------------

Preparing your project on GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start, `sign in to GitHub <https://github.com/login>`_
and navigate to the repository of the production pipeline, e.g.
`pipeline_rnaseq_hisat2 <https://github.com/sims-lab/pipeline_rnaseq_hisat2/>`_,
where you will see a grey button :guilabel:`Fork` in the top-right corner of the page.

* Click it to open a modal window that will ask you where you want to fork that repository.
* Select your GitHub username, or something suitable for a tutorial project.
